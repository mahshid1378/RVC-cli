## Installation Guides

### Windows

#### 1. **Install Dependencies:** 
    - Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window.
    - Navigate to the directory containing the `install.bat` file.
    - Run the `install.bat` file. This will create a Conda environment and install all necessary dependencies.
#### 2. **Run the RVC CLI:**
    - After installing requirements, you can start using the CLI. However, make sure you run the `prerequisites` command first to download additional models and executables.
    - Launch the application using:
      ```bash
      env/python.exe cli.py prerequisites
      ```
    - Once the prerequisites are downloaded, you can use the RVC CLI as usual.
### macOS & Linux

#### 1. **Install Python (3.9 or 3.10):** 
   - If you don't have Python installed, use your system's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:

      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install python3
      ```
#### 2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   - Open a terminal window.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `rvc_cli.py` file.
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      ```
#### 3. **Activate the Environment:**
   - Run the following command to activate the virtual environment:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
#### 4. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
#### 5. **Run the RVC CLI with `prerequisites`:**
    - Launch the application and run the `prerequisites` command to download additional models and executables.
      ```bash
      python cli.py prerequisites
      ```
#### 6. **Run the RVC CLI:**
    - After the prerequisites are downloaded, you can use the RVC CLI as usual.

**Note:**
